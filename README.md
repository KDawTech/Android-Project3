# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: Kevon Dawkins

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

## Summary

DogLingo is an android app that mimics the layout of the Duolingo goal page but tailored for dogs. The app presents a clean layout using ConstraintLayout, an image of a dog, and three informative text views. 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üê∂üì±üéØ

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Pick an app screenshot to duplicate
  - Be sure to add the screenshot to "Chosen Screenshot" below.
- [x] Create a runnable app that displays an Animal Version of your chosen screenshot
- [x] Layout uses one (1) or more ConstraintLayout
- [x] Layout uses one (1) or more ImageView
- [x] Layout uses three (3) or more TextViews

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Create a custom-shape Button using Shape Drawables
- [ ] Customize the text fonts by creating new Font Resources
- [ ] Add Tooltips to your Views to help users understand how to navigate the UI
- [x] Create a second layout, this time for an original, personal app idea

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] Added button navigation to a second activity
- [x] GIF demo added to drawable folder

## Chosen Screenshot

I have chosen to duplicate the following layout from the **Duolingo Goal Page** app:

## Original App Layout (Optional Stretch Feature)

Here is my entry for the "Create a second layout, this time for an original, personal app idea" stretch feature:

It is for an app that shows a confirmation message in a second activity screen.

## Notes

This project helped me practice using ConstraintLayouts and working with ImageView/TextView together. I also fixed theme crashes and learned proper resource naming conventions.
